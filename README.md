The Objective of this project is to use Machine Learning and Deep Learning model to predict the sentiment of Review (Positive or Negative).I used IMDB Movie Reviews dataset of 1,20,000 samples. Performed Data cleaning, Lemmatization using nltk, tokenization and vectorization using Count vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer and BERT Tokenizer. I used Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost classifiers and Deep Learning models like Hugging Face's BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformer model) for model training. Among all models, Transformer based BERT model achieved accuracy score of 0.906, precision score of 0.905, and F1 score of 0.902 on the test dataset. Explained the marginal performance of the model using Explainable AI packages like SHAP. Developed a sentiment analysis web application using Flask API and Learned deployment of the model on AWS Cloud.
